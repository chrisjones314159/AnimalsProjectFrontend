# AnimalsProjectFrontend


Introduction: 
Create an application that supports basic CRUD functionality.
Project Management was done via a Jira scrum baord and Git and GitBash were used for the version control system.
SQL was used for the database.
Java and Spring Boot were used to create the back-end of the application.
MockMvc was used for the testing.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to create the front-end.


Planning: 
I created a Scrum board using Jira and populated it with epics and user stories. The user stories were assigned a value, given a completion criteria and assigned child issues. For example, one of the user stories as to create functionality to allow users to search for an animal by name. the child issues for this were to create back-end functionality for this and design a front-end that the user can type in the animals' name they wish to search for.
